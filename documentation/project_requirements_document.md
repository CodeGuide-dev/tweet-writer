# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

We are building a web application that lets users log in with their Twitter account, import their tweets, and have an AI analyze their writing style to generate new tweets or threads in a similar voice. The idea is to give users an easy way to manage and generate content that feels authentically like theirs while leveraging the power of AI. This not only saves time for users looking for inspiration but also ensures that new content remains true to their unique online personality.

This project is being built to provide a seamless blend of social media management and AI-powered creativity. Our key objectives are to deliver secure and reliable Twitter authentication and tweet import functionality, accurate style analysis via the GPT-4o model, and a user-friendly interface that supports easy navigation from login to content generation. Success will be measured by how effortlessly users can generate content, the precision of the AI-generated tweets, and the system’s ability to handle rate limits and scalability without compromising on performance.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope:

*   Twitter OAuth authentication for secure user login.
*   Integration with the twitter-api-v2 npm library to fetch and manage tweets.
*   A dashboard displaying imported tweets with options to select samples for analysis.
*   A dedicated page for style analysis and AI-powered tweet generation using the GPT-4o model.
*   Optional integration with Twilio for posting directly to Twitter.
*   A settings/profile page for managing account details and content generation thresholds.
*   Using Next.js 14 with the app router for server-side rendered pages, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS with shadcn for styling.
*   Supabase for authentication, database management, and object storage.

### Out-of-Scope:

*   Advanced monetization features (subscription models, in-app purchases, etc.) – the app will not generate revenue.
*   Additional social network integrations – only Twitter integration is contended for the initial version.
*   Expansion into additional AI models beyond GPT-4o (although integrating the openai o3-mini model is a future possibility).
*   Complex role-based user permissions – all users have the same level of interaction.
*   Real-time content generation feedback – response times are not critical for this version.

## 3. User Flow

A new user will begin by visiting the login page where they will be prompted to authenticate via Twitter OAuth. Once logged in, the user is taken to a dashboard that displays their imported tweets. Here, the user can review their past tweets, select specific samples to be analyzed, and navigate effortlessly using a simple sidebar or menu.

After selecting tweets for analysis, the user proceeds to the Analysis & Generation page where the GPT-4o model evaluates their writing style. The generated content is then displayed, allowing the user to review, edit, or regenerate as desired. The overall experience is streamlined to ensure that switching between the dashboard and the content generation page is intuitive. The settings/profile page is always accessible to manage account preferences and tweak content generation thresholds, ensuring the user maintains full control over their data and style settings.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Twitter Authentication and OAuth Integration:**\
    Secure login using Twitter OAuth, ensuring that users’ credentials are handled safely.
*   **Tweet Importation:**\
    Utilizing the twitter-api-v2 library to fetch, manage, and display users’ tweets within the app.
*   **User Dashboard:**\
    A central hub where users can view their imported tweets and select samples for analysis.
*   **AI-Powered Style Analysis and Tweet Generation:**\
    Integration with the GPT-4o model (with future potential support for openai o3-mini) to analyze a user’s tweet style and generate new content that mimics their tone and phrasing.
*   **Optional Tweet Posting via Twilio:**\
    Allow users to post the generated content directly to their Twitter account.
*   **Settings/Profile Management:**\
    A dedicated page for users to manage account details, set content generation thresholds, and configure any app-specific preferences.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:**

    *   Framework: Next.js 14 using the app router for server-side rendering.
    *   Language: TypeScript for robust type safety.
    *   Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn to ensure modern, scalable design.

*   **Backend & Storage:**

    *   Platform: Supabase for authentication, database management, and secure object storage.

*   **Twitter Integration:**

    *   Library: twitter-api-v2 npm library to interact with the Twitter API for fetching and managing tweets.

*   **AI Model Integration:**

    *   Model: GPT-4o is used for analyzing tweet style and generating new content.
    *   Future Integration: Consider openai o3-mini for additional AI capabilities.

*   **Communication Integration:**

    *   Service: Twilio is used for optional integration, allowing users to post content directly to Twitter.

*   **Development Tools:**

    *   IDE: Cursor for AI-powered coding with real-time suggestions, ensuring smooth development and integration.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**\
    The application should load pages within 2-3 seconds for light use, with efficient caching and rate-limiting strategies in place to maintain performance during peak times.
*   **Security:**\
    Ensure secure handling of user data, especially during Twitter OAuth authentication. All API keys and sensitive data must be managed securely, with encryption where necessary.
*   **Compliance:**\
    Adhere to Twitter’s API usage policies and standard data privacy regulations. No sensitive personal data will be stored beyond what is necessary for functionality.
*   **Usability:**\
    Intuitive navigation with a clean UI that follows modern design principles. Priority is given to a blue primary color theme as specified for consistent branding.
*   **Scalability:**\
    The application should be capable of handling an increase in API usage as more users join, though expected load is light initially.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The application relies on the availability and proper functioning of Twitter’s OAuth and API endpoints via the twitter-api-v2 library.
*   Assumes GPT-4o is accessible and performs as expected for text analysis and content generation.
*   Supabase is assumed to correctly manage authentication, database operations, and object storage as needed.
*   No advanced monetization is planned at launch, and therefore, no subscription or payment integrations are required.
*   The user base is treated uniformly with no separate roles (like admin or moderator). Every user interacts with the app in the same way.
*   Scalability concerns are managed with caching strategies and simple rate-limiting because the initial load is expected to be light.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits:**\
    Twitter’s API and GPT-4o may be subject to rate limits. Mitigating this requires careful caching, retry mechanisms, and possibly fallback strategies for when API limits are reached.
*   **OAuth Authentication Challenges:**\
    Ensuring smooth Twitter OAuth integration may present issues, including handling token refreshes and managing potential authentication errors. Thorough error handling and user notifications are essential.
*   **Content Generation Consistency:**\
    The AI-generated output must closely mimic the user’s style. Discrepancies might occur if the input tweet samples are not representative or varied enough. Implementing a feedback loop for users to fine-tune the analysis parameters could help mitigate this.
*   **Integration Complexity:**\
    Integrating several services (Twitter, Supabase, GPT-4o, Twilio) increases the complexity and chances of miscommunication between APIs. Maintaining clear API contracts and robust error logging is necessary to debug issues quickly.
*   **User Privacy and Data Security:**\
    Even though standard compliance is planned, handling user data always poses risks. It is crucial to apply best security practices and possibly conduct regular security audits.
